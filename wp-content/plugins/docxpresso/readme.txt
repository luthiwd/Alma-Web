library designed to generate all kind of dynamical documents on your web server (PDF, Word, ODT, RTF). 

= How to use it =

1. Create a standard document with the content that you want to insert in your Post or Page using your favourite Word Processor (MS Word, Libre Office or Open Office).
2. IMPORTANT: Save your document in **.odt** format. In MS Word choose OpenDocument (*.odt) in your **Save As** dialogue (in Libre or Open Office is the default format).
3. Create or edit a Post or Page in your WordPress interface.
4. Click the **Docxpresso** button located over the text editor.
5. A standard WordPress media window will open. You may upload a new document with the required contents or use a previously uploaded document.
6. After choosing a file click on the **Insert** button.
7. A [docxpresso] shortcode will be included within your text editor.     
8. You may then add or not any additional content to your post but do not try to modify by hand the contents of the Docxpresso shortcode unless you really know what you are doing.
9. You may insert as many documents as you wish in a single Post or Page.

In case you want to make any of your tables sortable you also should:

1. Declare the first row of your table as a header row within your Office document
2. insert a "@" symbol as the first character in every column that you wish to be sortable
3. If you want to sort columns by numbers that do not follow the en-US standard, i.e. 3,576.45, you should modify the number format for sorting in your plugin options panel under the **Settings** section of your Wordpress installation
